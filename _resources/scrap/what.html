    <p>By <strong>CONNECTING</strong>, <strong>MOBILIZING</strong> and <strong>INFLUENCING</strong>, the global rangelands program strengthens ILC members’ activities in-country and across its continental platforms.</p>

<div class="text-heavy">
    <p>The key focus areas help ILC members develop and strengthen partnerships with a common vision of tenure security for rangeland users; identify, develop and/or scale up innovative solutions to tenure challenges, assisting governments and other actors in implementing enabling policy and legislation; and through sharing experiences and lessons learned, infuence these actors in land tenure development and implementation.</p>

            <!--<h2>AFRICA</h2>-->

            <!--<p>In Africa, the Rangelands Initiative works closely with a number of national governments on the development of policy and legislation that will best support the planning and protection of rangeland assets. A key tool in this regard has been the organization of ‘learning routes’—an interactive study tour undertaken by government, NGO and development agency representatives to host communities interested in sharing their experiences on making rangelands more secure</p>-->

            <!--<h2>ASIA</h2>-->

            <!--<p>The Rangelands Asia Initiative is coordinated by JASIL for Central Asia and by MARAG for South Asia. The two sub-regional initiatives plan together to ensure synergies and carry out cross-regional collaborative action. More than 70 million hectares of land in Asia are under commons, and 48-75% of rural populations depend on the commons in some way or another. The Rangelands Initiative Asia works to make these commons more accessible and tenure secure for local rangelands users through the development and implementation of that better supports productive rangeland systems; building the capacity of ILC Asia members and partners to engage with regional bodies, national governments and other actors; and advocacy and lobbying to raise awareness on pastoral land rights issues.</p>-->

            <!--<p>Launched in 2014 Plataforma Semiáridos de América Latina (ILC Latin America), has 14 members from six countries. The platform works on rangeland issues in the semi-arid lands of the Dry Corridor in Central America (found across Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras), the Chaco region (found across Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay), and northeastern Brazil.</p>-->

            <!--<p>Established to promote partnerships and alliances between organizations, and raise awareness on the problems facing and solutions for the semi-arid region, the platform: generates and shares knowledge, including on good practice; and undertakes advocacy campaigns to promote the livestock welfare of indigenous peoples and peasant communities, and secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, water and forests.</p>-->
